What I found out:
- Convert to Hindi text response for voice. Do not pass Hinglish to voice.
- Use defined voice settings given below
   stability=0.1, similarity_boost=0.1, style=0.5, use_speaker_boost=False
- Include SSML to reduce speed & pitch of voice. Eg:
 	<speak><prosody rate="x-slow" pitch="x-slow">
 	Movies are not just a timepass <break time="0.5s" /> Many parts of the movie like the dialogues create a lot of magic in our world
 	<break time="1.5s" />I hope you all liked this short demo...
 	</prosody></speak>
- Include pauses between sentence by:
   Add <break time="1.0s" />
   Add commas to include pause
- Text response to have random pause/stop words like um, uh etc
  example: Movies, oh my gosh, I just just absolutely love them. They're like time machines taking you to different worlds and landscapes, and um, and I just can't get enough of it.
- Text response to have randomly some words repeat (< 2% from total text) to show excitment/passion
